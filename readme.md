FIT3164-FOOD RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOODFLIX

Background:

Australia is filled with international students and workers who are open to experiencing new cultures. Being one of the countries with most immigrants and tourists, Australia has overwhelming options for food. Most people love to try new dishes and cuisines but also end up with bad experiences since making the choice is hard. There’s opportunity in providing these people with a way to easily choose a new dish to try or cook. However, there’s still a lot of unknowns when it comes to the combination of ingredients and/or different kinds of tastes that will make a dish more appetizing and tastier toward a person. There are also many other factors 0that can affect how food tastes, such as smell, look and texture which are very hard to measure or describe.

We are developing a web application that can be accessed from all platforms. The users can register and account and sign in to view the list of their favorite or most used recipes. They will be allowed to pick ingredients that are available at home and be given a set of Recipes that they can cook using the available ingredients. The users can also try out a new dish which will be recommended using our advanced recommendation system. They will also be shown a nearby restaurant that has the dish if the user wants to eat rather than cook. The users’ preferences will be updated in the database and will improve with more use by the user. The user will also be given the opportunity to rate the dish to make our recommendation system more precise

Our projects main aim is to provide people with an easy way to plan their meal. We believe that the application can recommend a good collection of dishes that are tasty, nutritious, and suitable for all people based on their budget, available ingredients, or nearby restaurant’s menus.

Our aim is to complete the project by Q2 2022. We will be using a hybrid Project management methodology using both predictive and agile methodology. The entire project has a time frame of twelve weeks and thus 12 sprints will be done at each sprint we are expected to complete the subtasks of develop and deploy section of our project schedule.
